Old Games Launcher is a combined DosBox frontend & a Direct Draw game/application starter. Old games like Age of empires, Age of empires 2, Diablo, etc... Relies on Direct Draw. Windows Vista & Seven Emulates Direct Draw. So if your game uses Direct Draw and uses 256 colors then your game will look ugly, will have graphical glitches, or simply won't start. The problem can be solved by manually closing explorer.exe when your program starts to run. However doing this manually is frustrating, so Old Games launcher starts your application & closes explorer.exe automatically and starts it when you finished gaming.

The DosBox frontend part of it makes starting dos applications easy. You donâ€™t need to mount folders, type a lot of commands to start your application. DosBox is integrated into the program, so you don't need to download & install it manually.
